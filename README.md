# ma_crossover_strategy
A fast slow moving average crossover strategy

A very basic cross over strategy where you go long when the slow moving average goes above fast moving average and you go short when the slow moving average goes below the fast moving average.

I used this strategy to backtest my live returns in the market.
Do let me know if any issue is present in the code or you want to understand more about the strategy.
